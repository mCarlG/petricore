#+TITLE: SpacEmacs Configuration
#+FILETAGS: :wip:decision:

Currently, I'm using this as my userconfig. I've been thinking about whether I
could use other files to improve modularity, but this works for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (setq org-roam-directory "~/Notes/roam/")
  (setq org-roam-db-autosync-mode t)

  (require 'ox-publish)
  (setq org-html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/custom.css\" />")
  (setq org-publish-project-alist
        '(("org-roam-notes"
           :base-directory "~/Notes/roam/"
           :base-extension "org"
           :publishing-directory "~/Notes/roam/public_html"

                                                    (plist-get plist :output-file))
                              "<nav><a href=\"/\"><- home</a></nav>"))

#+END_SRC

It's only really setting up two things: org-roam and org-publish.

Pretty clear that this is just setting the home directory and enabling
autosyncing the db:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq org-roam-directory "~/Notes/roam/")
(setq org-roam-db-autosync-mode t)
#+END_SRC
