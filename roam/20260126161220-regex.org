* Choice information
Regex will arbitrarily match pattern in a line unless pinned to a location.
Any meta-character to be used literally must be escaped with a =\= prepending it.
Generally find what excludes the bad case.

Groups can be nested.
Groups will only capture what is enclosed in =()=.
Groups can typically be referenced with =\{some_num}= (like =\0= or =\1=).
Groups are referenced from =\1= onwards; =\0= is the whole matched string.

=|= can decide what to OR a little arbitrarily. Maybe on whitespace as well as group?
All set matchers (like =\d=) can be inversed through capitalization.

Flags can be combined like =(?im)=.

* Sets
- =\d= will match any digit [0-9].
- =\w= will match any alphanumeric [A-Za-z0-9_].
- =\s= will match any whitespace.

* Globbing
- =[]= encapsulating a collection of characters indicates an OR.
- =-= can be used inside =[]= to indicate a sequential range of values to be represented: =[a-z]=.
- ={}= can be appended to a character to indicate number of instances to match: ={4}=.
- =,= can be used in some engines inside ={}= to designate a range: ={1,5}=.
- =()= will capture characters match in a group for later use.
- =?:= inside =()= will result in a non-capturing group: =(?:.*)=.

* Pinning
- =^= is a meta-character IN =[]= for NOT.
- =^= is a meta-character OUTSIDE of =[]= for start of line.
- =$= is a meta-character for end of line.
- =\b= is a boundary between alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric character.

* Matching
- =.= is a meta-character for literally anything (including =\n= with =(?s)=).
- =*= is a meta-character for 0 or more matches.
- =+= is a meta-character for 1 or more matches.
- =?= after QUANTIER (=*=, =+=, ={d+,d+}=) is a meta-character for laziness.
- =?= after REGULAR CHARACTER/TOKEN is a meta-character for optionality.
- =|= indicates an OR for the whole sequence.

* Flags
- =(?i)= flag for case-insensitive.
- =(?m)= flag for multiline (=^= and =$= match line boundaries).
- =(?s)= flag for dotall, making =.= match newlines.
